# Author-Identification-using-Text-Snippets

This project is inspired by the Kaggle competition [Spooky Author Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification/).

Aim is to crawl author data off the web and create a corpus of it. To clean the data obtained and make a dataset of authors corresponding to iconic/unique/habitual sentence snippets from their work. Finally to train a ML model to identify authors based on these text snippets.

This project is pursued for Machine Learning Course CSE-543 at IIITD.
